## How the bot was developed

1. I decided to make a python application that integrates with a third-party API.
2. I solved the I/O bount load with asynchronous python,
   And I solved the CPU bount load with C/C++.
3. I chose Telegram as a client, it's better than writing the frontend myself.
4. I also recommend using venv

PS. Don't forget to specify your token in bot.py.))
